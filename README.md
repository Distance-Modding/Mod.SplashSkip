# Distance Splash Skip

Distance mod to skip splash screen and startup delays, and boot right into the main menu without needing to press any key. *"Boot up the game White-Lighting-fast!"*

## Current Options

* Skip REFRACT splash animation.
* Skip startup checks for newly-subscribed/unsubscribed Steam Workshop levels.
    * Note that checks can still be performed from *Main Menu **&gt;** Workshop*.
* Skip the *press any key* Idle menu and immediately boot into the main menu.
    * Note that it's still possible to view the Idle menu by pressing back.


## Known Bugs

* The "LOADING" text will glitch out a little on startup, like is often seen when exiting the level editor in vanilla.
